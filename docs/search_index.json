As graduate students, besides finishing our studies, finding a suitable job is also one of the most important things for us. Especially in New York, a bustling international city, there are opportunities everywhere. Many companies have openings and are eager to hire competent people. However, although there are many job postings, it is always a problem for job seekers to find the most suitable job for them from all the information of these job postings. Therefore, our group chose the topic of job postings in New York City to help people better choose the jobs that suit them by summarizing the useful information and trend from these job postings, such as salary, location, and skills. What’s more, we also focus on some questions that graduate students also care about when they look for jobs, for example, what skills or requirements are needed to get a high salary job? What kind of job position is needed most in NYC? For people with fixed salary ranges and fixed job categories, what kind of jobs suit him and are in high demand? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Our group collected the data together. It is from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Jobs/kpav-sd4t. This dataset contains current job postings available on the City of New York’s official jobs site: http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml. This dataset has 2838 rows and 30 columns. Each row is a Job Posting from one company. Each column is one kind of information for each job posting. For these 30 variables: Job ID (num): Job Opening ID. Agency (chr): Name of the City agency where the vacancy exists. Posting Type (chr): Internal or External job posting. Internal postings available to city employees and external postings available to the general public are included. #Of Positions (num): Number of vacancies to be filled. Business Title (chr): Business title Civil Service Title (chr): Civil Service title Title Classification (chr):All Civil Service title are grouped into four categories: Competitive Class/Non-Competitive Class/Labor Class/Exempt Class.

(Blank means post until filled) Posting Updated (chr): Last Modification Date. Process Date (chr): Dataset created date. The problem with this data is that there are some blank value. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation From website https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Jobs/kpav-sd4t, we can directly downloaded the CSV file of this dataset. Then we use read_csv to get this dataset and store it as NYC_Jobs so that we can work with it in R. However, there are 30 variables in this dataset and some of them are not useful. For variable “Recruitment Contact”, all of its contents are empty in this dataset. For variables “Title Code No”, “Level”, “To Apply”, “Posting Date”, “Posting Updated”, “Process Date”, the information of their contents are not helpful for job seekers to find a suitable job. For variables “Division/Work Unit”, “Job Description”, “Additional Information”, according to the different job postings, their contents are very different, which are not conducive to analyze and create visualizations. Thus, we decided to delete these variables. In addition, we did data transformation in variables “Residency Requirement” and “Minimum Qual Requirements” to simplify their contents and convert them to information that we are interested in. From the information of variable “Residency Requirement”, we create a new variable “residency” to transform the original contents into “required” and “not required” which show whether this job postings need residency Requirement or not. Then from the information of variable “Minimum Qual Requirements”, we create a new variable “degreereq” to focus on the degree requirements from the original contents. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values For convenience, we replace all empty value to NA first. ## [1] 2838 22 Our dataset has 2838 rows and 30 columns. We want to check if there is any missing value in our NYC job dataset. ## col ## Hours/Shift 2050 ## Post Until 1803 ## Work Location 1 1517 ## degreereq 659 ## Preferred Skills 294 ## Full-Time/Part-Time indicator 198 ## Minimum Qual Requirements 23 ## residency 13 ## Job Category 2 ## Career Level 2 ## Residency Requirement 2 ## Job ID 0 ## Agency 0 ## Posting Type 0 ## # Of Positions 0 ## Business Title 0 ## Civil Service Title 0 ## Title Classification 0 ## Salary Range From 0 ## Salary Range To 0 ## Salary Frequency 0 ## Work Location 0 We can see that there are total 12 columns have missing values. We decide to ignore Minimum Qualify Requirement, To Apply, Job Category, Career Level and Residency Requirement because they only have less than 1% missing values in 2838 records. We choose 7 columns that have more than 1% missing values to draw the missing pattern graph From above plot we can observed that there are 53 different patterns. There are no rows recorded as complete for all variables. The reason may be each job position is different. The most common pattern is missing of Recruitment Contact, hours shift, Post Until and location. From above plot, we can see that 100% of Recruitment Contact are missing, so we decide to drop this column. The hours/Shift have over 75% values are missing, and for those values that are not lost, they are very different from each other, and are also difficult for us to classify and compare, so we decide to remove this column. The Post Until column have over 50% values are missing but we will keep it because Post Until is a date that the job post is available, and the missing means this post will remain available until filled. The Prefered Skill column have 10% values are missing. We will keep it because the missing means this post do not have prefered skill requirement. For other variables, we will determine how to deal with them after we finish data transformation. Since Business title is one of the most important variables,we choose some records to analyze the relationship and check if our decision is right. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Most major job category 5.2 Relationship of Salary &amp; Category and Salary &amp; Degree Requirement 5.3 Residency requirement and Full-Time / Part-Time job indicator 5.4 Degree requirement and Career Level 5.5 Title Classification 5.6 External and Internal 5.7 Word Cloud for Preferred Skills", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Most major job category To help job seekers realize how many job postings are available for each job category and the competitiveness of various categories of jobs so that they can choose a more suitable job, We want to know the demand for different categories of jobs in New York city. From this job posting data variable “Job Category”, for each job posting, our group extract the job category that can best represent the job, and store them and their counts in a new data frame “category”. From the graph above, we can find that the number of job posting for “Technology” is largest, which is more than 450, and the number of job posting for “Clerical” is smallest. For “Technology”, “Constituent Services”, and “Engineering”, these three job categories have the top three number of job postings. If people want to choose jobs from these categories, they will have more choices than people who choose from “Social”, “Information”, and “Clerical”. 5.2 Relationship of Salary &amp; Category and Salary &amp; Degree Requirement For people who are finding jobs, the number of salary is always one of the most important information they are interested in. To make our graphs more useful and not to disappoint the job seekers, we choose the lower bound of salary range from each job posting whose salary frequency is annual as the value of salary. Then we create the box plots related to salary &amp; job category and related to salary &amp; degree requirement. From the graph above, we can find except job categories “Clerical” and “Information”, for each other job category, there are some outliers in its salary distribution. What’s more, this graph shows that for those job postings whose job categories are “Technology” and “Information”, the amount of salary people can get is generally higher than those job postings whose job categories are “Social” and “Clerical”. In particular, for job category “Clerical”, the amount of salary people can get is generally lower than any other categories of job. Combining with the first graph “Most Major Job Category” in section 5.1, we can notice that job category “Technology” not only has the largest variety of job postings, but also has better salary distribution than other job categories. For job category “Clerical”, it has the smallest variety of job postings and the almost worst salary distribution. However, more variety of job postings does not always equal to better salary. For job category “Information”, although it has the second lowest number of job postings, it ranks second in term of salary. In contrast, for job category “Constituent Services”, although it ranks second in the number of job postings, it has the third lowest salary. From this graph, it shows a trend that except “Doctorate” (since the number of job postings whose degree requirement needs “Doctorate” is very small), the higher the degree requirement, the higher the salary. For job postings that need master’s degree, the median of minimum annual salary is around 75000. But for those job postings that need associate degree, the median of minimum annual salary is just around 50000. Therefore, it is always beneficial for job seekers to improve their education level before looking for a job. Sometimes it is not enough for job seekers to just know the information of minimum salary. Here we plot this graph to show the mean salary, the maximum salary, and the minimum salary job seekers can get from each job category. Combining with the first graph “Min Annual Salaries by Job Categories” in section 5.2, for job categories “Engineering”, “Administration”, “Constituent Services”, “Building”, “Finance”, and “Social”, they rank higher based on mean salary than they rank based on median of minimum salary. However, for job category “Legal”, although it ranks third in terms of median minimum salary, it has the second lowest number of mean salary, and the value of its mean salary is close to its median of minimum salary. This information shows job seekers who want to work in “Legal” job category can get a better minimum salary guarantee, but the salary they eventually get will not change much. 5.3 Residency requirement and Full-Time / Part-Time job indicator Although this dataset contains the job postings available in New York City, some job postings are not available for all job seekers in New York City since there exists some job postings that need New York city residency requirement. Furthermore, some job postings are not suitable for job seekers who just want to find a full-time job or just want to get a part-time job. In this section, we will analyze the residency requirement and the full-time / part-time indicator in these job postings. We group all job postings according to their job categories. In this graph, for each job category, it shows the amount of job postings that require the residency requirement and the amount that do not require, and the total amount. We can find for job category “Information”, all of its job postings do not have residency requirement, and for job category “Clerical”, all of its job postings need residency requirement. What’s more, we notice that for most of the job categories, the amount of “required” is greater than the amount of “not required”. Only in job categories “Technology”, “Engineering”, and “Information”, the amount of job postings that do not require New York residency requirement is greater than the amount that require. This information shows now New York City provide a convenient employment environment for some international students whose major is about “Technology” or “Engineering”. In this graph, we show the amount of full-time jobs and the amount of part-time jobs for each job category. It shows for job categories “Information” and “Clerical”, they just have full-time jobs. For all job categories, the amount of full-time jobs are greater than the amount of part-time job. It means that full-time work seems to have gone mainstream in New York. What’s more, we can find job category “Health” has the most number of part-time jobs. Thus, if you prefer to find a part-time in New York, “Health” category can provide more choices to you. 5.4 Degree requirement and Career Level In this section, we focus on analyzing the two most important requirements that job seekers will pay attention to when they look through these job postings: Degree requirement and Career Level. We want to know whether a higher career level can substitute for higher degree level, or whether higher degree level can substitute for higher career level? 5.5 Title Classification 5.6 External and Internal Except the New York residency requirement, these job postings have another restriction variable “Posting Type” whose meaning is internal or external job posting. And the dataset claims that internal postings available to city employees and external postings available to the general public are included. To find more information about internal and external, we create a scatter plot to show the relationship between job category and this posting type. In this graph, 5.7 Word Cloud for Preferred Skills In the last section, we will focus on the keywords that appear in the variable “Preferred Skills” from the whole job posting dataset.
