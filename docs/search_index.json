[["index.html", "NYC Job Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " NYC Job Analysis Yunxiao Wang, Shangzhi Liu 2021-12-13 Chapter 1 Introduction This project is created by Yunxiao Wang and Shangzhi Liu in Final Project Group 39. As graduate students, besides finishing our studies, finding a suitable job is also one of the most important things for us. Especially in New York, a bustling international city, there are opportunities everywhere. Many companies have openings and are eager to hire competent people. However, although there are many job postings, it is always a problem for job seekers to find what kind of jobs are suitable for them from all the information of these job postings, especially for those who feel confused and don’t have a specific direction of employment. Therefore, our group choose the topic of job postings in New York City to help people better choose the jobs that suit them and determine their work direction by summarizing the useful information and trend from these job postings, such as salary, categories, requirements, and skills. What’s more, we also focus on some questions that people also care about when they look for jobs, for example, what kind of job category or requirements are needed to get a high salary? What kind of job position is needed most in NYC? For people who have no direction but have specific requirements for the future salary range, what kind of jobs suit them and what requirements or skills should they need to possess in order to get this kind of jobs? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Our group collected the data together. It is from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Jobs/kpav-sd4t. This dataset contains current job postings available on the City of New York’s official jobs site: http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml. Internal postings available to city employees and external postings available to the general public are included. The reason why we choose this dataset is that it is from the City of New York’s official website, which is very reliable, representative and updated. Therefore, it can show more useful information and trends about job postings in NYC. This dataset has 2838 rows and 30 columns. Each row is a Job Posting. Each column is one kind of information for each job posting. For these 30 variables: Variable Data Type Description Job ID (num) Job Opening ID. Agency (chr) Name of the City agency where the vacancy exists. Posting Type (chr) Internal or External job posting. Internal postings available to city employees and externalpostings available to the general public are included. #Of Positions (num) Number of vacancies to be filled. Business Title (chr) Business title Civil Service Title (chr) Civil Service title Title Classification (chr) All Civil Service title are grouped into four categories: Competitive Title Code No (chr) Civil Service title Code Level (chr) Civil Service title level Job Category (chr) Full-Time/Part-Time indicator (chr) Full time or Part time Job Career Level (chr) Career Level Class Salary Range From (num) Proposed salary from: range. (Can be 0) Salary Range To (num) Proposed salary to: range. (Can be 0) Salary Frequency (chr) Proposed salary frequency Work Location (chr) Agency location. Division/Work Unit (chr) Department/Division within the hiring agency. Job Description (chr) Description of the job responsibilities for this position. Minimum Qual Requirements (chr) Minimum qualifications required for position. Preferred Skills (chr) Preferred skills for this position. Additional Information (chr) Additional information provided by the hiring agency. To Apply (chr) Instructions on how to apply for this postion. Hours/Shift (chr) Working hours and shift information. Work Location 1 (chr) Specific work location for this opening. Recruitment Contact (logi) Recruitment contact information. Residency Requirement (chr) Residency requirements for this position. Posting Date (chr) Date that the position was posted. Post Until (chr) Date Posting will be removed. (Blank means post until filled) Posting Updated (chr) Last Modification Date. Process Date (chr) Dataset created date. The problem with this data is that there are some blank value, and when we work with variable “Career Level”, although it shows the type of this variable is chr, when one of our group member work with this variable, it shows the type of this variable num and cannot read it. Thus, we create a new column to rename and store its value. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation From website https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Jobs/kpav-sd4t, we can directly downloaded the CSV file of this dataset. Then we use read_csv to get this dataset and store it as NYC_Jobs so that we can work with it in R. However, there are 30 variables in this dataset and some of them are not useful. For variable “Recruitment Contact”, all of its contents are empty in this dataset. For variables “Title Code No”, “Level”, “To Apply”, “Posting Date”, “Posting Updated”, “Process Date”, the information of their contents are not helpful for job seekers to find a suitable job. For variables “Division/Work Unit”, “Job Description”, “Additional Information”, according to the different job postings, their contents are very different, which are not conducive to analyze and create visualizations. Thus, we decided to delete these variables. In addition, we did data transformation in variables “Residency Requirement” and “Minimum Qual Requirements” to simplify their contents and convert them to information that we are interested in. From the information of variable “Residency Requirement”, we create a new variable “residency” to transform the original contents into “required” and “not required” which show whether this job postings need residency Requirement or not. Then from the information of variable “Minimum Qual Requirements”, we create a new variable “degreereq” to focus on the degree requirements from the original contents. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values For convenience, we replace all empty value to NA first. ## [1] 2838 22 After data transformation, our dataset has 2838 rows and 22 columns. We want to check if there is any missing value in our NYC job dataset. ## col ## Hours/Shift 2050 ## Post Until 1803 ## Work Location 1 1517 ## Preferred Skills 294 ## Full-Time/Part-Time indicator 198 ## Minimum Qual Requirements 23 ## residency 13 ## Job Category 2 ## Career Level 2 ## Residency Requirement 2 ## Job ID 0 ## Agency 0 ## Posting Type 0 ## # Of Positions 0 ## Business Title 0 ## Civil Service Title 0 ## Title Classification 0 ## Salary Range From 0 ## Salary Range To 0 ## Salary Frequency 0 ## Work Location 0 We can see that there are total 10 columns have missing values. We decide to ignore Minimum Qualify Requirement, Job Category, Career Level and Residency Requirement because they only have less than 1% missing values in 2838 records. We choose 5 columns that have more than 1% missing values to draw the missing pattern graph From above plot we can observed that there are 30 different patterns. There are near 7% rows recorded as complete cases.The most common pattern is missing of hours shift, post until and work location 1, about 25% of total rows. And the amount of the pattern whose missing is hours shift and work location 1 is around 12.5% of total rows, which is similar to the amount of the pattern whose missing is hours shift and post until. The reason is that for hours shift, many job postings do not have uniform standards; for post until, blank means post until filled; and for work location 1, many job postings have given their work locations in variable “Work Location” and do not one more specific work location. The hours/Shift have over 75% values are missing, and for those values that are not lost, they are very different from each other, and are also difficult for us to classify and compare, so we decide to remove this column. The Post Until column have over 50% values are missing but we will keep it because Post Until is a date that the job post is available, and the missing means this post will remain available until filled. The Preferred Skill column have 10% values are missing. We will keep it because the missing means this post do not have preferred skill requirement. For other variables, we will determine how to deal with them when we make visualization. Since Business title is one of the most important variables,we choose some records to analyze the relationship and check if our decision is right. From this graph we can find most of this business titles miss “Hours/Shift”, but for variable “Preferred Skills”, almost all business titles have a value. Thus, our decision is right. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Most major job category 5.2 Relationship of Salary &amp; Category and Salary &amp; Degree Requirement 5.3 Residency requirement and Full-Time / Part-Time job indicator 5.4 Degree requirement and Career Level 5.5 Title Classification 5.6 External and Internal 5.7 Word Cloud for Preferred Skills", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Most major job category To help job seekers realize how many job postings are available for each job category and the competitiveness of various categories of jobs so that they can choose a more suitable job, We want to know the demand for different categories of jobs in New York city. From this job posting data variable “Job Category”, for each job posting, our group extract the job category that can best represent the job, and store them and their counts in a new data frame “category”. From the graph above, we can find that the number of job posting for “Technology” is largest, which is more than 450, and the number of job posting for “Clerical” is smallest. For “Technology”, “Constituent Services”, and “Engineering”, these three job categories have the top three number of job postings. If people want to choose jobs from these categories, they will have more choices than people who choose from “Social”, “Information”, and “Clerical”. 5.2 Relationship of Salary &amp; Category and Salary &amp; Degree Requirement For people who are finding jobs, the number of salary is always one of the most important information they are interested in. To make our graphs more useful and not to disappoint the job seekers, we choose the lower bound of salary range from each job posting whose salary frequency is annual as the value of salary. Then we create the box plots related to salary &amp; job category and related to salary &amp; degree requirement. From the graph above, we can find except job categories “Clerical” and “Information”, for each other job category, there are some outliers in its salary distribution. What’s more, this graph shows that for those job postings whose job categories are “Technology” and “Information”, the amount of salary people can get is generally higher than those job postings whose job categories are “Social” and “Clerical”. In particular, for job category “Clerical”, the amount of salary people can get is generally lower than any other categories of job. Combining with the first graph “Most Major Job Category” in section 5.1, we can notice that job category “Technology” not only has the largest variety of job postings, but also has better salary distribution than other job categories. For job category “Clerical”, it has the smallest variety of job postings and the almost worst salary distribution. However, more variety of job postings does not always equal to better salary. For job category “Information”, although it has the second lowest number of job postings, it ranks second in term of salary. In contrast, for job category “Constituent Services”, although it ranks second in the number of job postings, it has the third lowest salary. From this graph, it shows a trend that except “Doctorate” (since the number of job postings whose degree requirement needs “Doctorate” is very small), the higher the degree requirement, the higher the salary. For job postings that need master’s degree, the median of minimum annual salary is around 75000. But for those job postings that need associate degree, the median of minimum annual salary is just around 50000. Therefore, it is always beneficial for job seekers to improve their education level before looking for a job. Sometimes it is not enough for job seekers to just know the information of minimum salary. Here we plot this graph to show the mean salary, the maximum salary, and the minimum salary job seekers can get from each job category. Combining with the first graph “Min Annual Salaries by Job Categories” in section 5.2, for job categories “Engineering”, “Administration”, “Constituent Services”, “Building”, “Finance”, and “Social”, they rank higher based on mean salary than they rank based on median of minimum salary. However, for job category “Legal”, although it ranks third in terms of median minimum salary, it has the second lowest number of mean salary, and the value of its mean salary is close to its median of minimum salary. This information shows job seekers who want to work in “Legal” job category can get a better minimum salary guarantee, but the salary they eventually get will not change much. 5.3 Residency requirement and Full-Time / Part-Time job indicator Although this dataset contains the job postings available in New York City, some job postings are not available for all job seekers in New York City since there exists some job postings that need New York city residency requirement. Furthermore, some job postings are not suitable for job seekers who just want to find a full-time job or just want to get a part-time job. In this section, we will analyze the residency requirement and the full-time / part-time indicator in these job postings. We group all job postings according to their job categories. In this graph, for each job category, it shows the amount of job postings that require the residency requirement and the amount that do not require, and the total amount. We can find for job category “Information”, all of its job postings do not have residency requirement, and for job category “Clerical”, all of its job postings need residency requirement. What’s more, we notice that for most of the job categories, the amount of “required” is greater than the amount of “not required”. Only in job categories “Technology”, “Engineering”, and “Information”, the amount of job postings that do not require New York residency requirement is greater than the amount that require. This information shows now New York City provide a convenient employment environment for some international students whose major is about “Technology” or “Engineering”. In this graph, we show the amount of full-time jobs and the amount of part-time jobs for each job category. It shows for job categories “Information” and “Clerical”, they just have full-time jobs. For all job categories, the amount of full-time jobs are greater than the amount of part-time job. It means that full-time work seems to have gone mainstream in New York. What’s more, we can find job category “Health” has the most number of part-time jobs. Thus, if you prefer to find a part-time in New York, “Health” category can provide more choices to you. 5.4 Degree requirement and Career Level In this section, we focus on analyzing the two most important requirements that job seekers will pay attention to when they look through these job postings: Degree requirement and Career Level. We want to know whether a higher career level can substitute for higher degree level? In this mosaic graph, it shows when career level changes from “entry-level” to “executive” (from low level to high level), the percent of high school diploma requirement become smaller and smaller, and the percent of master’s degree requirement become larger and larger. The percent of Doctorate requirement is very low for all of these career levels. Also, the percents of bachelor degree requirement and associate degree requirement are similar in career levels “entry-level”, “Experienced”, and “Manager”. But in career level “executive”, the percents of both degree requirement are almost 0, almost all degree requirements are from master’s degree and bachelor degree. Adding all these information together, we find higher career level cannot substitute for higher degree level, instead, when job postings’ career level become higher, their degree requirements also become higher and do not need people whose degree is low. In this mosaic graph, we analyze the relationship between degree requirement and posting type &amp; residency requirement. For all job postings that do not require New York residency requirement: the degree requirement of external posting type is very similar to the degree requirement of internal posting type. The percent of bachelor degree requirement is more than 50% in both of these two posting type, which is the largest. The second largest percent of degree requirement is master’s degree, which is around 33%. The percent of Doctorate requirement is smallest. For all job postings that requires New York residency requirement: The percents of Doctorate and master’s degree requirement are similar in both external and internal posting type. However, for job postings whose posting type is external, their percent of bachelor degree requirement is higher , and their percents of associate degree and high school diploma are smaller than those whose posting type is internal. For all external job postings: we can find the percents of master’s degree and Doctorate degree requirement in “not required” are greater than those in “required”. This shows the external job postings that do not need New York residency have higher requirements for high-end degrees than external job postings that need New York residency. Similar for internal job postings, the internal job postings that do not need New York residency have higher requirements for high-end degrees than internal job postings that need New York residency. 5.5 Title Classification All NYC job positions have 4 job classes: competitive, non-competitive, exempt and labor. Competitive means these positions require examination. Exempt means competitive or non-competitive examinations or other qualification requirements are not practical. Labor Positions are positions is mainly engaged in unskilled manual labor, like cleaner and driver. Non-Competitive Positions are positions that are not in the exempt class or the labor class and examination has been determined to not be practicable. Is there any difference in salary between each class? In this ridgeline plots, one for each kind of “Title Classification”, it shows us how the number of job postings of each title classification changes with the lower bound of salary range. We can find that for job postings whose title classifications are “Competitive-1”, “Pending Classification-2”, and “Non-competitive-5”, their low bound of salary range are concentrated around 50,000 dollars. “Exempt-4” is more likely to get a higher salary, with one peak near 100,000 dollars and one peak near 150,000 dollars. However, for job postings whose title classification is “Labor-3”, most of it low bound salary range is less than 50,000 dollars, which may because it is unskilled job. 5.6 External and Internal Except the New York residency requirement, these job postings have another restriction variable “Posting Type” whose meaning is internal or external job posting. And the dataset claims that internal postings available to city employees and external postings available to the general public are included. To find more information about internal and external, we create a scatter plot to show the relationship between job category and this posting type. In this graph, for each job category, we set some categories are more “external” if its number of external job postings is greater than the number of internal job postings times 0.8, some categories are more “internal” if its number of external job postings is less than the number of internal job postings times 0.6, and else categories are “neutral”. From the graph, we can find for job categories “Clerical”, “Social”, and “Administration”, these categories are more “internal”. For job categories “Information”, “Policy”, “Public”, “Legal”, and “Constituent Services”, they are more “external”. Other categories are “neutral”. Thus, for job seekers who are not city employees now, it is difficult to work in Administration. 5.7 Word Cloud for Preferred Skills We noticed that each job has a specific long paragraph to describe the Preferred Skills, so we will focus on the keywords that appear in Preferred Skills from the whole job posting dataset. By split all words and drop all meaningfuless word like conjunctions, numbers and symbols, we generate a worldcloud with 100 most frequent words. There are many information we can extract from above wordcloud. For example, we can see that’Data’,‘Microsoft’,‘excel’ appear around 1000 times, and ‘team’,‘project’, ‘manage’ appear more than 500 times. This may indicate most employer expect the job seeker are familar with microsoft office and have basic data analysis ability. What’s more, experience with team project may also be a bonus for job seeker.

If job seekers want to get a higher salary, it will be good choice for them to get a master’s degree and then work in the technology or information field. What’s more, higher career level cannot substitute for higher degree level, it is always beneficial for job seekers to improve their education level before looking for a job. From the Word Cloud, we can notice that if job seekers want to improve their competitiveness, it would be better for them to improve their skills about Excal, Microsoft, and project experience. For people who have no direction but have specific requirements for the future salary range, for example, they want to achieve an annual salary between 75000 and 100000 dollar, it would be better for them to find jobs whose title Classification is “Exempt-4” or “Non-competitive-5”, and technology kind of job is the most of recommended job for them, followed by engineering kind of job. Most of job postings for these two kinds of job are neutral type, full time job and do not need New York City residency. After getting these information, these job seekers can better plan for their future. From this project we learned that data processing skills and extract information ability are the foundation of data visualization. For each visualization, we spent more time on chose the right type and deal with the input data than draw the plot. The limitations in our project are that the objects we analyze and conclude are just a series of job postings that have some same information. We did not analyze some specific jobs or return some specific Job IDs to help job seekers find their job. The future direction for our project is to figure out these limitations and try to help job seekers find the most suitable job with its specific job ID, not just a group of jobs.
