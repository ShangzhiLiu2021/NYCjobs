As graduate students, besides finishing our studies, finding a suitable job is also one of the most important things for us. Especially in New York, a bustling international city, there are opportunities everywhere. Many companies have openings and are eager to hire competent people. However, although there are many job postings, it is always a problem for job seekers to find the most suitable job for them from all the information of these job postings. Therefore, our group chose the topic of job postings in New York City to help people better choose the jobs that suit them by summarizing the useful information and trend from these job postings, such as salary, location, and skills. What’s more, we also focus on some questions that graduate students also care about when they look for jobs, for example, what skills or requirements are needed to get a high salary job? What kind of job position is needed most in NYC? For people with fixed salary ranges and fixed job categories, what kind of jobs suit him and are in high demand? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Our group collected the data together. It is from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Jobs/kpav-sd4t. This dataset contains current job postings available on the City of New York’s official jobs site: http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml. This dataset has 2838 rows and 30 columns. Each row is a Job Posting from one company. Each column is one kind of information for each job posting. For these 30 variables: Job ID (num): Job Opening ID.

"],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation From website https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Jobs/kpav-sd4t, we can directly downloaded the CSV file of this dataset. Then we use read_csv to get this dataset and store it as NYC_Jobs so that we can work with it in R. However, there are 30 variables in this dataset and some of them are not useful. For variable “Recruitment Contact”, all of its contents are empty in this dataset. For variables “Title Code No”, “Level”, “To Apply”, “Posting Date”, “Posting Updated”, “Process Date”, the information of their contents are not helpful for job seekers to find a suitable job. For variables “Division/Work Unit”, “Job Description”, “Additional Information”, according to the different job postings, their contents are very different, which are not conducive to analyze and create visualizations. Thus, we decided to delete these variables. In addition, we did data transformation in variables “Residency Requirement” and “Minimum Qual Requirements” to simplify their contents and convert them to information that we are interested in. From the information of variable “Residency Requirement”, we create a new variable “residency” to transform the original contents into “required” and “not required” which show whether this job postings need residency Requirement or not. Then from the information of variable “Minimum Qual Requirements”, we create a new variable “degreereq” to focus on the degree requirements from the original contents. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values For convenience, we replace all empty value to NA first. ## [1] 2838 22 Our dataset has 2838 rows and 30 columns. We want to check if there is any missing value in our NYC job dataset. ## col ## Hours/Shift 2050 ## Post Until 1803 ## Work Location 1 1517 ## degreereq 659 ## Preferred Skills 294 ## Full-Time/Part-Time indicator 198 ## Minimum Qual Requirements 23 ## residency 13 ## Job Category 2 ## Career Level 2 ## Residency Requirement 2 ## Job ID 0 ## Agency 0 ## Posting Type 0 ## # Of Positions 0 ## Business Title 0 ## Civil Service Title 0 ## Title Classification 0 ## Salary Range From 0 ## Salary Range To 0 ## Salary Frequency 0 ## Work Location 0 We can see that there are total 12 columns have missing values. We decide to ignore Minimum Qualify Requirement, To Apply, Job Category, Career Level and Residency Requirement because they only have less than 1% missing values in 2838 records. We choose 7 columns that have more than 1% missing values to draw the missing pattern graph From above plot we can observed that there are 53 different patterns. There are no rows recorded as complete for all variables. The reason may be each job position is different. The most common pattern is missing of Recruitment Contact, hours shift, Post Until and location. From above plot, we can see that 100% of Recruitment Contact are missing, so we decide to drop this column. The hours/Shift have over 75% values are missing, and for those values that are not lost, they are very different from each other, and are also difficult for us to classify and compare, so we decide to remove this column. The Post Until column have over 50% values are missing but we will keep it because Post Until is a date that the job post is available, and the missing means this post will remain available until filled. The Prefered Skill column have 10% values are missing. We will keep it because the missing means this post do not have prefered skill requirement. For other variables, we will determine how to deal with them after we finish data transformation. Since Business title is one of the most important variables,we choose some records to analyze the relationship and check if our decision is right.
